**Task Summary:**

The task is to develop test cases for a REST API designed for a blog platform. This involves ensuring the API functions correctly across various scenarios and meets the specified requirements.

**Key Requirements:**

- The API should handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for blog posts.
- User authentication and authorization must be tested.
- The API should support different user roles (e.g., admin, editor, reader) with appropriate permissions.
- Ensure data validation and error handling are robust.
- Test cases should cover all endpoints, including edge cases and negative scenarios.
- The API must be performance tested for scalability.

**Breakdown:**

1. **Phase 1: Requirements Gathering**
   - Identify all API endpoints and their expected behavior.
   - Understand user roles and permissions.
   - Determine performance requirements.

2. **Phase 2: Test Case Design**
   - Develop test cases for each CRUD operation.
   - Create test scenarios for authentication and authorization.
   - Design test cases for data validation and error handling.
   - Plan performance tests.

3. **Phase 3: Test Case Implementation**
   - Implement test cases using a suitable testing framework.
   - Automate test cases where possible.

4. **Phase 4: Test Execution and Reporting**
   - Execute the test cases.
   - Document and report any issues or bugs found.
   - Provide a summary of the test coverage and results.

**Planning Needs:**

- The Planner should focus on creating a detailed plan for test case development, considering the complexity of the API.
- Prioritize test cases based on critical functionalities and potential risk areas.
- Determine tools and frameworks for test automation and execution.

**Documentation Needs:**

- A comprehensive Test Plan document outlining the scope, objectives, resources, and schedule for testing.
- A Test Case Specification document detailing each test case, including inputs, expected results, and execution steps.
- A Test Execution Report summarizing the outcomes of the test cases, including any defects or issues identified during testing.
